# This is an excellent and well-organized configuration structure! 
# The numbering sequence perfectly represents the logical loading order and logical grouping of related configurations:

# 00-09: Core environment setup 
# 10-19: XDG and base directories 
# 20-29: Package management 
# 30-39: Secrets and plugin management 
# 40-49: Language and runtime environments 
# 50-59: Shell enhancements and utilities 
# 60-69: File operations and tools 
# 70-79: Editors and IDEs 
# 80-89: Key bindings and input handling 
# 90-99: System utilities and services

# chmod 600 ~/.config/fish/conf.d/30-secrets.fish
# chmod 700 ~/.config/fish/conf.d/  # Restrict execution to the user
