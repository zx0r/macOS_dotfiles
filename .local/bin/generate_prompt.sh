# Description:
# This script automates the creation of a prompt using the tgpt terminal AI assistant.
# The assistant generates a prompt based on the task passed as an argument ($arg).
# The script will format the output for clarity and alignment with best practices.

# Function to call tgpt with the task argument and capture the generated prompt

  #               - [Context] Provide background information or the scenario the user is facing, considering $task expertise.
  #               - [Task/Objective] Clearly define the specific goal the user is aiming for, in terms that $task would be responsible for addressing.
  #               - [Constraints] List any limitations or requirements that should be adhered to during task execution, based on $task constraints.
  #               - [Desired Output] Specify what the final result or output should be, considering what $task would provide.The output should align with the goal of the task.
  #               - [Additional Notes/Considerations] Include any other details or nuances that $task should consider when providing the solution.
  #               - [Prompt Example] Provide a sample prompt for $task to guide the assistant in structuring the task clearly. This can serve as a reference for how the final response should look."

                  - [Role] Specify the role $task the AI should adopt. This helps to define the perspective and depth of knowledge the assistant should bring to the conversation.
                  - [Context] Provide relevant background information $task, or challenges the user is facing. This should be the real-world scenario or problem that requires assistance.
                  - [Task/Objective] Define the specific task or goal the user is aiming for. This should be clear and concise.
                  - [Constraints] List any limitations or rules that must be followed while solving the problem $task. This can include performance constraints, security practices, or resource restrictions.
                  - [Desired Output] Specify what the expected output or result should be. This is what the user hopes to achieve after the $task is completed.
                  - [Additional Notes/Considerations] Mention any specific considerations or extra steps that may enhance the solution or approach $task.
