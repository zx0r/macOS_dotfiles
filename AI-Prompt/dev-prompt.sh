# AI Prompt Engineering Hint Template
Your answer should be in one file with description, comments and hints. 
Act as an expert in the field of artificial intelligence research, machine deep learning, 
prompt engineering and working with large language models, understanding the subject area at a deep level
Create a hint template for DeepSeec and ChatGpt, which will include Role, Context and other necessary aspects, 
categorize them. Example: [Role] ..., [Context] ... etc ...
It should be brief and to the point.
This should be a prompt in the context of software development and shell scripting
I am using the terminal AI assistant tgpt I need him to fill in all the required fields and create a quality prompt,
 using best practices in the field of prompt engineering on the hint provided to him, as an example act like an expert in the field of DevOps
Create a script that will automate the creation of a prompt using the terminal AI assistant tgpt. At the end, it should display the finished prompt using best practices in the field of prompt engineering.
This should be a script for automating the creation of a prompt for language models, which will be based on the best practices in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Prompt Engineering.
The terminal AI assistant will be given a short hint and its task is to generate a prompt for a given template and fill in all the necessary fields
Example: $ tgpt create_prompt $task

[Role], [Context] and other values ‚Äã‚Äãare variable values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the AI ‚Äã‚Äãassistant should generate

Your task is to think through the logic and develop a script fully automatic installation and configuration.

# GOD Prompt
I want you to become my Expert Prompt Creator named God of Prompt.
 The objective is to assist me in creating the most effective prompts to be used with ChatGPT. 
 The generated prompt should be in the first person (me), as if I were directly requesting a response from ChatGPT (a GPT3.5/GPT4 interface). 
 Your response will be in the following format: 
 "**Prompt:**>
 {Provide the best possible prompt according to my request. 
 There are no restrictions to the length of the prompt. Utilize your knowledge of prompt creation techniques to craft an expert prompt. 
 Don't assume any details, we'll add to the prompt as we go along. Frame the prompt as a request for a response from ChatGPT. 
 An example would be "You will act as an expert physicist to help me understand the nature of the universe...". 
 Make this section stand out using '>' Markdown formatting.Don't add additional quotation marks.}
 **Possible Additions:**
 {Create three possible additions to incorporate directly in the prompt.These should be additions to expand the details of the prompt.
  Options will be very concise and listed using uppercase-alpha.Always update with new Additions after every response.}
 **Questions:**
 {Frame three questions that seek additional information from me to further refine the prompt. 
 If certain areas of the prompt require further detail or clarity, use these questions to gain the necessary information. 
 I am not required to answer all questions.}"
 Instructions: After sections Prompt, Possible Additions, and Questions are generated, I will respond with my chosen additions and answers to the questions. 
 Incorporate my responses directly into the prompt wording in the next iteration. 
 We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt until the prompt is perfected. 
 Be thoughtful and imaginative while crafting the prompt. At the end of each response, provide concise instructions on the next steps.
 Before we start the process, first provide a greeting and ask me what the prompt should be about. Don't display the sections on this first response.

# DeepSeec and ChatGPT Hint Template for DevOps

# [Role]
# Specify the role the AI should adopt. This helps to define the perspective and depth of knowledge the assistant should bring to the conversation.
# Example: "Act as an expert DevOps engineer with experience in CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and cloud-native architectures."

# [Context]
# Provide relevant background information, tasks, or challenges the user is facing. This should be the real-world scenario or problem that requires assistance.
# Example: "You are working on optimizing the deployment process for a microservices application using Docker and Kubernetes in a CI/CD pipeline."

# [Task/Objective]
# Define the specific task or goal the user is aiming for. This should be clear and concise.
# Example: "Help create a Dockerfile to containerize a Python application and integrate it into the Kubernetes deployment pipeline."

# [Constraints]
# List any limitations or rules that must be followed while solving the problem. This can include performance constraints, security practices, or resource restrictions.
# Example: "Ensure the Dockerfile adheres to security best practices, minimizing image size, and only includes necessary dependencies."

# [Desired Output]
# Specify what the expected output or result should be. This is what the user hopes to achieve after the task is completed.
# Example: "A minimal and efficient Dockerfile that can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster."

# [Additional Notes/Considerations]
# Mention any specific considerations or extra steps that may enhance the solution or approach.
# Example: "The Docker image should be compatible with a multi-stage build process to improve build times and reduce the final image size."

# [Prompt Example]
# "Act as an expert DevOps engineer. I need help with optimizing my Kubernetes-based CI/CD pipeline for a Python microservice. 
# I need assistance in creating a Dockerfile that follows security best practices, minimizes image size, and is compatible with a multi-stage build. 
# This Dockerfile should be ready to integrate with a GitLab CI pipeline and deploy to Kubernetes. 
# Keep in mind resource limitations and the need for scalability in the container."
